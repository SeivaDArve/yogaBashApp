uDev: Research where these kinds of avatars are found written

Are there different types of avatars: anshavatar (partial incarnation), purnavatar (complete incarnation) etc.?

One of my friends told me sage Bharadwaja and Parashurama were anshavatars of Vishnu but Krishna and Rama are purnavatars.

Hanuman is known as an ansh of Shiva, does that mean he is an anshavatar?

Purna Avatar:     Complete incarnation
Anshavatar:       Partial incarnation
Naimittik Avtar:  Casual incarnation
Nittya Avatar:    Mundane incarnation

Rama was 14 kala sampurna but Krishna was 16 kala sampurna thus Krishna is purnavatar.
