There is a website that replicates the experience of truly, experientially pointing at the center of the universe and of your own consciousness. Where you point at something that everybody is pointing at, and in the end, you are the one pointing at it, so, you feel as if you are somebody else and actually you are everybody else.... if you distance yourself from the center of consciousness, this experience goes away
The website is: https://pointerpointer.com/
